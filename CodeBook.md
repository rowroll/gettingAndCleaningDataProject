# Code Book for Course Project in Getting and Cleaning Data
## Due date 27 September 2015

This code book describes the variables, the data, and transformations or work performed to clean up the data.

## The Data and Variables
The data is contained in a file called tidyData.txt.  It is derived from data described below in the chapter "The Original Data".

tidyData.txt contains 180 observations of 69 variables, along with headers for each variable.  It was created using write.table with row.names=FALSE in R.  It can be read using tidyData <- read.table("tidyData.txt") in R.

Each observation (i.e. row) describes the average of each original variable (see columns 4 to 69) for one activity and one subject. The columns (variables) of tidyData.txt are:

1. ActivityId, which is an integer number between 1 and 6
2. ActivityName, corresponding to ActivityId, is one of: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING
 
3. SubjectId, which is an integer number ranging from 1 to 30, one for each subject.

## The Original Data

The _original_ data comes from the following project:

==================================================================

Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
Version 1.0

Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto.
Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory
DITEN - UniversitÃ  degli Studi di Genova.
Via Opera Pia 11A, I-16145, Genoa, Italy.

==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

### For each record it is provided:

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

### The dataset includes the following files:

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

### Notes: 

- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.

## Transformation of the Original Data

The original dataset was fragmented, and the following steps were taken to unify it.  

First of all the names of the activities (see activity_labels.txt)  were added to the activity identifying data in y_test.txt and y_train.txt.

Then, the data in y_test.txt (ActivityId, and ActivityName), subject_test.txt (SubjectId), X_test.txt (measurements) were combined into one table, and the same was done with  y_train.txt (ActivityId, and ActivityName), subject_train.txt (SubjectId), X_train.txt (measurements).

Next, the two big tables were combined, and given header names for the activity columns, and subject Id.  The remainder of columns got names derived straight from features.txt.

Once the big table had been created, a subset of it was created including only the activity and subjectId info, as well as only the mean() and std() measurements.

This table was then used to only select observations belonging to one activity and one subject, and the average of each mean() and std() measurement was found and recorded, one number per measurement.

This information was stored in a new table, and saved as tidyData.txt.
